# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 14, 2020
Today's Progress: Officially publicly pledged my commitment to the #100daysofcode challenge. Below is a number of code and tech related things I worked on: -> Did a quick recap of fundamental HTML/CSS. I am self-learning off Udemy.com - The Web Developer Bootcamp

-> Worked with algorithms and coded a program using C language as part of the CS50 coursework on Edx.
-> Activated and dedicated an official instagram account for my self-learning journey in code. 
Find here: https://www.instagram.com/katiekodes/
-> Set up an official Github account and still trying to get my head around the interface. I'm not too sure what all the functions mean or do so I am learning as I go

-> Lastly, set up my official website dedicated to coding projects, creative works at the like. It is simply a portfolio that I had my mind on for a while for all my works including writing, travel, cooking, technology posts etc. I decided this opportunity would be fitting for me to weave all those elements into one, nestled neatly in one website, which I will be launching very soon.

**Thoughts**: I really struggle with organising my thoughts when it comes to coding. I hope to improve this in time. C language is really a challenge. In fact, I still struggle with C, because I feel there is a little bit of logic behind it. Nevertheless, I feel I'll get better with it once I become more used to coding, recognising patterns and simply practicing.


### Day 2: April 15, 2020
Today's progress involved: 
-Diving into HTML5 today, transitioned from beginner to intermediate
-Began working with CSS today. Using learned concepts and applying it to build my website. 

**Thoughts**:  
I learned a crucial lesson today. This involved being able to organise my thoughts and manage my time well. I often find myself in a rabbit hole, link hopping and just HUNGRY for learning more and more. I tend to get distracted with learning multiple languages, but it is imperative to slow down and take it one at a time. 

Overall, today I discovered these soft skills are significant to successfully and smoothly continue my work in code, and everywhere else in life. 

### Day 3: April 16, 2020 
üëâüèªLearned about debugging on C today with #CS50
üëâüèªLearning to style my HTML code with CSS
üëâüèªUnderstanding CSS rules for styling the UI

**Thoughts** 
I learned to manage my time better, breaking big tasks into bite sized chunks to work with. A similar concept is applied when hiking. We all want to conquer the mountain, but it is about taking individual steps, slowly walking the incline until we reach the top.
Most importantly, remem bering or even better, LEARNING to take breaks. Understanding our bodies and minds needs breaks. A habit of mine is that get so obsessed with my work, I forget to take a break.

I closed the laptop yesterday at 12am. Crazy...Need to learn to take breaks.  
Something I will learn to improve along the way, in code and conquering the mountain! 

### Day 4: April 17, 2020
#100daysofcode [Day 004/100]: 

Today I decided to mix it up rather than do my usual coding. 

I attended a Webinar held by @GA and was doing a live code-along, along with other students so it felt more inclusive.

**Thoughts***

Coding is starting to feel natural to me now, grasping the concept of HTML and CSS, consequently leading to me having 
a glimpse of JS today. I personally feel that I should be doing more projects than following the exercises from the courses I'm doing. 
Perhaps that will be the challenge for next week. 

In terms of soft skills, I would like to be more productive and efficient in my work. Rather than spending long hours coding. Regardless, I am having fun! So it's not all that bad. :) 

### Day 5: April 19, 2020
Learned how to use Class CSS to style multiple HTML elements. 
Because it was the weekend, I decided to play some games in code. 
So I jumped into playing this game: https://www.bt.com/codeacake/ 

**Thoughts** 

I find it hard to keep up with coding on the weekends. Things somewhat slow down? So I end up not doing much code or studying. 
I'm sure that's okay right? :D sometimes we all need a little break :') 

### Day 6: April 20, 2020 

Did everything CSS today; from specificity levels to important selectors, to fumbling around with borders and colours. 
Also had some fun with manipulating and interacting with different websites' elements using the Chrome Inspector. How cool is that! 

**Thoughts** 
Not much coding done as it is the weekend, so I decided to take a break. I feel like it is good to take a break from my streaks every now and then, so I did miss a day on Sunday. 
However! As per the FAQ on the #100daysofcode challenge, it is okay to miss a day, but as long as you continue the day after, it's fine. 

### Day 7: April 21, 2020 
Worked with Bootstrap elements (nav bars, forms and inputs etc) today.
 
Was getting jaded from 'tutorial hell' so I began working on a number of projects to practice and refine coding practices. I also began JS today, time to walk the backend journey! 
After discovering bootstrap, it feels like a box of lego pieces have been given to me, and all I have to do is define what I want to create and start putting all the pieces together! 

Also, built a Netflix landing page clone using  HTML, CSS and JS 

**Thoughts** 
I feel like I am quite slow in progress...perhaps I am still new to the whole developer space and trying to find my feet in navigating the programming world. 
I'm always expecting myself to be at the peak of the mountain when I am still walking the climb to the first tea house. 
Im slowly getting better at time management, but it's a progress. I feel that I do get carried away often, having sudden bursts of overambition. 

I plan to create a routine and utilise work techniques so that I can be productive and not just 'busy' all the time. 

### Day 8: April 22, 2020 
Today was all about writing and experimenting with JS - primitives, conditionals, variables and experimented with the chrome JS developer console. 
I also built a music app :D (added source music, colours and everything!) It's not perfect, but I'm learning.  

**Thoughts** 
Working with JS reminded me of working with C language in CS50. 
I think this is where I need to understand the computer logic, computer science and syntax of programming before working with JS - because I am still struggling to understand it. I'm thinking if I did a review of the fundamentals, perhaps I'll get the hang of it soon. 

### Day 9: April 23, 2020 

Today was another day of working with JS, debugging my code, trying to make things work and did some JS exercises on: 
http://asmarterwaytolearn.com/js/1.html (<- this was amazing) 

**Thoughts** 

Compared to the HTML and CSS counterpart, learning Javascript was the steepest and longest climb so far. Personally, JS logic somewhat reminds me of programming in C when I was learning #CS50. However, I realised that in order to code in JS, I needed to understand the underlying fundamentals. So I dived deeper into ways I could learn JS more productively rather than do code-along tutorials. I think I'm getting the hang of it!

### Day 10: April 24, 2020

Last two days consisted of working with JS fundamentals, wrote and evaluated while loop exercises, created some simple games using conditionals and variables. 
Progressing with the fundamentals of JS.

**Thoughts** 

I used to struggle with understanding the logic behind while loops when learning C in #CS50. But that all changed when I started reading "Learning Javascript the Smarter Way". 
Compared to the HTML and CSS counterpart, learning Javascript was the steepest and longest climb so far. Personally, JS logic somewhat reminds me of programming in C when I was learning #CS50.

Now with my new learned skills and knowledge, I can't wait to see what projects I'll tackle next week! Can't say it was the smoothest sailing learning JS, but I can say I am embracing it, and taking the opportunity to run with it, because that is all part of learning :)

### Day 11: April 25, 2020 

Today was ANZAC day and it as it is the weekend, my schedule for learning code is slightly different compared to what I do on the weekday. 

Today was about revising JS concepts and learning about best practices in coding. 

**Thoughts** 

Sometimes it is good to take a break from the norm and revise earlier learnings as it can be good to solidify knowledge and reframe understanding concepts.
I'm also beiginning to take a break from posting on my social media too often. I feel like it takes away from productive learning. 
I am thinking of posting every two days and collating my days together. 
Although the rule of posting what you learn online to keep oneself accountable is a great idea, at the end of the day, only I can keep myself accountable. Learning programming has taught me a multitude of lessons, but one of the greatest takeaways from this experience is that only YOU are responsible for your actions, choices and how your day goes. Consequently, this resonates throughout one's life. 

### Day 12: April 26, 2020 

Not much coding, as I continued with the Web Dev Bootcamp on UDEMY, learning more about different loops in JS, objects and arrays.
Did some light reading on The Smarter Way to Learn JS. 

### Day 13: April 27, 2020 

1. Did a quick JS exercise, worked with for loops and different types of functions. 
2. Today's coding was different from my usual daily studies. I used my coding skills to re-design the layout of a client's product store website, using, SIMPLY CODE. I remember back in the day I would use the 'drag-and-drop'-method of a platform's elements (e.g. wordpress, wix etc) to design a beautiful webpage. But once you learn the power of programming & design, you can tweak and transform with the power of your imagination and fingertips. There comes a rewarding feeling when you successfully build something from scratch and is original.

### Day 14: April 28, 2020 

Worked on a project today: building my own linktree webpage.
I had the option of signing up online, however, I thought I would give myself a bit of 
a challenge and put my learned front-end programming to good use before 
progressing on in JS and more. 

**Thoughts**

Quite satisfying to work on owned projects. It is rewarding and I encounter a number of 
lessons. I learned an important aspect of front-end web development today: 
polishing the user interface and user experience of the webpage. I understand this will come through work application, experience and 
meeting client briefs, but it is also good to learn now. 
Learned about ensuring web page has responsive design to multiple platforms such as iphones, ipads, and desktop. 
Things I can work on: 
-planning out/drawing out what it is/what the webpage will look like
-learning more about CSS styling - had to google quite a number of times what CSS names equated to what 
design I wanted. 
-learn to take regular breaks... I tend to get carried away and forget what time it is.

### Day 15: April 29, 2020 

Continued through the Bootcamp course, evaluating functions, writing arguments (return),  function declarion vs function expression, and finally, scope (notoriously difficult of them all...) 

**Thoughts** 
Today's session took a cerebral toll on me. I have a difficult time understanding the logic behind it all, but I believe with practice, I will get there. 
I am also learning to chunk my tasks together and manage my time properly. It's not perfect, but it is improving :') 

### Day 16: April 30, 2020 ###

Worked with higher order functions in JS and mainly did some revision and exercises. 

**Thoughts**
Are there such thing as an off day? Because yesterday was one of those days. 

Compared to how comfortable I am with HTML or CSS, JS is definitely more difficult for me to grasp.
Nevertheless I think it's all about coming out of my comfort zone and embracing it. Taking a step and the opportunity, and running with it.

### Day 17: May 5, 2020 ###
Had my previous days tied and jam packed, so tried to do revision in the meantime. Did not get any coding as I wanted to dedicate quality time to learning, rather than rush it and do a futile post.

Continued through the Web Dev Bootcamp. Really wanting to finish the bootcamp.
Developed a go to workflow for my code and working on projects: such as the linktree app,
to do list etc 

**Thoughts**
Slowly starting to feel stuck on Javascript. Realising I am being overambitious with my coding goals and time. I have so many projects I want to do but not properly managing my time. 
This is a work in progress....

### Day 18: May 6, 2020 ### 
Today I continued with Arrays on the Udemy Web Dev Bootcamp. I also continued working on my linktree project and started another project - building a to do list. 

**Thoughts** 
I'm wondering why I take a while to code. Or get a project out. I can understand why in the workplace they implement methodologies such as agile and scrum. I suppose it is still in the early stages of my learnings, so I can't expect myself to have mastered project management methodologies. Learning to take it one step at a time. 

### Day 19: May 7, 2020 ###

Last couple of days have been about building projects. 
I've given 'learning'coding a break for a while and just to start coding. 
There's such a fine difference there. Although following tutorials can be a start,
I learn best by doing and experimenting. As it sticks with me more.

### Day 20: May 8, 2020 ### 
Today I was working with arrays and objects to access data. Found it really awesome that one is able to use them in conjunction with another and being able to access layers and layers of data. I learned about DOM today, the Document Object Model - essentially an organization chart automatically created by the browser for the entire web page. The most fundamental way to understand DOM is by designating parent and child nodes to the org chart. It was like understanding the heiarchial structure in a company, in biology and the organisation of nature (yes the scientist in me came out to play today :D) 
Continued on with coding my project. 

### Day 21: May 9, 2020 ### 
I've been quite all over the place with coding lately. I don't really code on my days off, but rather, I revise concepts and my learnings. I feel that's important to master one concept and move on. Otherwise knowledge would be 
fragmented.

Today I continued with building JS projects and doing more of my course on UDEMY. 
I started to work with Python and so that was something new. 

Continued my Bootcamp course and manipulated the DOM using JS methods. 
Most of the day was working with working on my JS to do list and
debugging my code! 

 **Thoughts** 
I realise I take a long time to do this project, or maybe it is still 
my first projects so I'm still getting the hang of it. 
Js is still very difficult for me...or maybe it is the way I am studying it.
Maybe I should go over the concepts again. I'll get there!


### Day 22: May 14, 2020 ### 
I worked with JS methods for DOM manipulation, enabling developers to manipulate, create & style dynamic web pages, which was quite interesting. There are 5 important DOM Selectors that allow us to manipulate and work with DOM. 

‚ñ∫document.getElementById()
‚ñ∫document.getElementsByClassName()
‚ñ∫document.getElementsByTagName()
‚ñ∫document.querySelector()
‚ñ∫document.querySelectorAll()

We can also manipulate an element's style through the style property and more. Essentially, the crux of it all is to first SELECT element and then MANIPULATE.

Next I will be moving onto Advanced DOM Manipulation in my course
I also completed my To-Do List App 

**Thoughts** 

Building the first To-Do List app was by far the most challenging. I am beginning to envision how a product or project comes together. That is, planning, analysing variables, goal settings and then execute. This is no industry related experience talk here, I am deducing as I go. I hope to get some industry related experience soon. 

Staying positive! 

### Day 23: May 18, 2020 ### 

Today I decided to play catchup with my previous projects, brushing up and doing some fine tuning. Was revising some previous concepts in JS and overall doing research for my short term goals. 

**Thoughts**
I haven't been coding on the weekend as lately, as last few days I was caught up with some events, however, I am keen to get back on it! I try to not be too hard on myself if I don't get any "coding" done on the weekend. I treat this challenge like the average business hours; 8-6 or 9-5 depending, and on weekends are my recharge and off days. 

Essentially this challenge aims to foster good habits such as coding daily, best practices and building a habit to continually learn.

I love learning overall, so I think it's all okay :) 

### Day 24: May 19, 2020 ### 

Today was quite good, I started my day off with a fresh mind and got straight into progressing in my course. 
I was working with Advanced DOM Manipulation today. This included: introduction to events, toggle, changing colors and styles on a webpage, and begin building some games to solidify learned knowledge. 

Next I will be moving on to jQuery. 

**Thoughts** 

It's starting to become so fun! I am also starting to comprehend in my mind the code that is used to build and operate the websites that we regularly visit, games we play and apps we use. Once you understand the language that you're favourite website, app or game was built on, it is purely magical! 

I also can't wait to progress more onto jQuery! Been patiently climbing steep mountains to reach the tea house with delicious food, honey & lemon drinks and picking up more gems of wisdom! 


### Day 25: May 20, 2020 ### 

Working with jQuery, why use it, the difference between jQuery vs JS, when to use it and began coding with it. I began using jQuery selectors to manipulate the webpage. Overall, just like DOM manipulation and Vanilla JS, the concept of SELECT and MANIPULATE is prevalent. 

**Thoughts** 

It was important to be mindful of how you would write the code and manipulate DOM without using jQuery and understand the capabilities, pros and cons of each tool. 

### Day 26: May 21, 2020 ### 

Another day of working with jQuery, being able to demonstrate the new style and the console feeding back the changes made with DOM manipulation. I also moved on to Advanced jQuery methods:
Understood the concept of other common jQuery methods: 
val()
text()
attr()
html()

jQuery analogues:
addClass()
removeClass()
toggleClass() 

->It was imperative to note that these methods can be found on api.jqeruy.com, listing all methods and what they do (aviding memorisation)


**Thoughts** 
I think I am beginning to extract the pattern that is forming when working with jQuery. Now it's all about application. 

### Day 27: May 22, 2020 ### 
Not much coding today as I continued to learn jQuery and jQuery events. 
Went through the more advanced jQuery methods: 

1. click() - adding a click listener to elements 
2. keypress() - triggered when a user types on the keyboard; triggers an event on the element
3. on() - works similar to addEventListener; allows you to specify the TYPE of event to list for. E.g. a double click, a single click, dragstart etc 


**Thoughts** 
Really want to advance further than I hoped so. Next week will be going into NodeJS and backend!! FINALLY! 

### Day 28: Tuesday May 26, 2020 ### 

Summary: 
Today went through some backend workflow - request and returning
Worked with text editor and terminal (somewhere to start the server and have it listening), a browser to make requests 


*get request (retrieve info): through the browser
*post request (add info): through a form, take a name that is sent in the request, and when submitted, there is an instantaneous request.

Walked through: servers, routes & HTTP  

Writing fullstack JS apps

Using GoormIDE - a powerful cloud based IDE (integrated development environment) 
IDE - your complete developer environment to make an app, set up in the browser.
Has your text editor, your server, debugging tools. Writing applications in the browser

Introduction to Command Line, using CD and LS, learning how to create directories, delete directories, creating & deleting files using solely the Command Line. It was a skill in itself without using the mouse! 

### Day 29: Wednesday May 27, 2020 ### 

Did an introduction to NodeJS, built my first Node app. 
Created and executing JS and ruby files using Node.
Started a new JS project. 

**Thoughts** 
I feel like my time management is going in curves, highs and lows. It definitely isn't linear. 
I really want to try and keep at it. Work better and do better. 

### Day 30: Thursday May 28, 2020 ### 

Introduction to NPM concept today - a node package manager. It is the Node version of libraries & applications published on npm. Essentially code which someone wrot, and are added online everyday. Such applications can be found via npmjs.org 

NPM has a command line tool, where we can install things easily. It can be installed with a single command-line. 

When people create web apps, they usually install and work with NPM packages rather than writing plain JS

Examples of packages which I worked with: Express and Mongoose 

### Day 31: Friday June 06, 2020 ### 

This week was a bit rocky. Although that is no excuse to stop coding. I think sometimes there can be a bypass between coding and learning. I've been busy wiht learning a lot of theoretical concepts this week. I am under a traineeship with Upskilled in Programming at the moment. So I have been doing some progrmming assignments with them. 
Doing my best to squeeze in some JS projects and JS revision. 

Learned about package JSON: 
Package.json is the recipe needed for a specific package or library. Go in and install 
Metadata about an application or a package e.g name, version

--save = flag to install packages 

Route Parameters: 
Routing or router in web development is a mechanism where HTTP requests are routed to the code that handles them. To put simply, in the Router you determine what should happen when a user visits a certain page. 

Route orders:
the importance of route orders - So we determine the router and it will determine what happens when user visits the page


### Day 32: Friday June 12, 2020 ### 

I have been doing some assignments from my training course with Upskilled so coding has taken the back seat this week. However, as a developer, I believe it's good to cultivate that coding habit daily. So today I decided to reset and code again. 
I learned about APIs and learning to write a code to make API requests with Node. 

**Thoughts** 

I learned to break down big tasks into small bite sized chunks in a systematic and sequential order. So I was quite pleased with myself. 
This week I have been juggling quite a number of tasks. But this is where time management is key. 
I also learned about software development methodologies. 

Such methods can be a good way to keep track of my projects in my life too. 

### Day 33: Tuesday 16 June, 2020 ### 

Finished creating a JS app and summarised working with Express JS 

### Day 34: Thursday June 18, 2020 ###

Did an express routing assignment and revised some previous concepts

### Day 35: Friday June 18, 2020 ### 

Continued working on route paramaters, understanding best practices and implementing code.

**Thoughts** 
Juggling 100 Days of Code with a full time training course is quite full on. However, I realise I am probably juggling multiple things at once and better to learn the art of balance and prioritising my time again. 

### Day 36: Wednesday June 24, 2020 ### 

It is clear by now that I do not code on the weekend. As I feel it is good to take a break from my everyday work once in a while. 

Today I worked with EJS and the NPM. 
It took me a while to understand EJS, adding routes and rendering to a specific file. It's important to understand this type of logic really well, where we are able to fill a template in with data coming back from a database or data a user has provided and it‚Äôs not a static file that is the same every time. 


### Day 37: Thursday June 25, 2020 ### 

I'm starting to forget to log on github as I have my own log on excel. 
However, that is no excuse. 

I continue on with the UDEMY course and learned more about post routes, important EJS tags and really grasphing the logic in working with EJS and node. 

### Day 38: Wednesday 1st July, 2020 ### 

I was revising previous concepts. 
I decided to revise some JS and do more JS projects. Kind of getting exhausted doing tutorials. 

I also learned about UML and modelling today as part of my course. 
I had a glimpse at web design basics and understanding the terms and principles. 

**Thoughts** 

I REALLY, have to start coding daily again. 
I've been quite caught up in a a number of other things, such as working for some partners, writing, content creation and perhaps spending too much time on my assessments on my traininng program. 

Time to reset! I can do this! 

### Day 39: Thursday 2nd July, 2020 ###

Today I decided to revisit some Javascript functions and decided to complete the Responsive Web Design course on freeCodecamp. 
I successfully understood the algorithms for compound assignments for Augmented Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. 

I'm curious to see how this would play out in a real project. 

I also continued my UPSKILLED course, and learned about the UML model types and Use Case diagrams: activity, class and relationships. 
I feel it is important to familiarise myself with such information as it would be useful for me to get to know how it would be implemented in real life. 

### Day 40: Wednesday 8th July, 2020 ### 

I have gone through a number of coding topics today. Listed below are the bullet points: 

*understanding the concept of arrays and knowing how to pull and call the data forward in ejs 

*making routes follow convention called REST. 

*styling with partials (embedded files in another)

*app.post// get data from form and add campgrounds to array

*body parser install: npm install body--parser --save

*telling express to use bodyParser

*Create header and footer partials in separate mkdir and quick styling using boostrap

*Creating images and making the web app RESPONSIVE is an important factor in web dev. i.e. styling the images in grids etc 

*Conceptualising a web app - from body content, to responsive design, to the navigation bar + responsive, adding navbar to each page etc. Every little detail counts

----
Revisting front end frameworks and in depth design principles. 
CSS design principles: consistency, succinctness and separation. 

I decide to learn about some design tools today, Figma. 
How cool! 

### Day 41: Friday 10th July, 2020 ### 

Redid the Yelp camp project because I didn't understand. 
Practice some JS concepts. 
Learned about different prototyping tools in system design and Business Analysis Foundations. 

**Thoughts** 
I feel like it is a rush to get something out these days. Especially with coding. I'm learning to balance my time more properly, but it could be better. 
I'm trying to quickly push through tutorials and really just code. But I think I'm slowly losing the hang of it if I don't commit to it daily. Or doing CONSECUTIVE days of coding.


### Day 42: Sunday 12th July, 2020 ### 

It's a Sunday but I really wanted to sit down and do some revision, continue with coding to create Responsive Design.

Started a new JS project today. 
JS concepts that were used in the project involved: 

DOM Manipulation
Control Structures
Array.forEach()
JavaScript CSS Manipulation
eventListeners
Immediately Invoked Function Expressions

**Thoughts** 
I feel like I should be more specific with what I'm writing or logging down. 
More specific detail of what I was coding. E.g. the JS project, what concepts were involved etc 

### Day 43: Monday 13th July, 2020 ### 
Continued with my course focusing on databases today. Database = collection of information and an interface; some sort of language of tech/tools to interact with this data

Concepts learned: 
*SQL and nonSQL. 
*relational database - tabular and ordered. relating data is done through multiple tables and using IDs 

*non-relational: no defined tables. more flexible structure. JS with key varlue pairs. Comments can be nested.
in data 
*SQL or nonSQL have been around the longest. 
*focus is the difference between relational or non relational. broad difference. 

---
learning how to install mongoDB on GOORM 

*start writing some MongoCode

### Day 44: Tuesday 14th July, 2020 ### 
Continued with course. Working with UML modelling and prototyping an app today 

### Day 45: Wednesday 15th July, 2020 ### 
"Working with Mongo Shell Basics and mongo code to update and access data from a database. 
CRUD command (created, read, update and delete) insert, find, update and remove. 

*remove - by default wil remove anything that you provide it. If you only want to remove 1, then insert ""limit (1)"" 
*update - must use $set to not alter any information other than the one you are changing 

Played around with my Wix website and was able to code using Corvid! Time to animate and add new apps onto my website.

### Day 46: Thursday 16th July, 2020 ### 
Using UML markup to code UML diagrams
Continued working on my website. 
Experimented with Corvid code as I was curious haha 

### Day 47: Wednesday 22nd July, 2020 ### 
Continued on building my web app, Reponsive Web Design & Learning React

React - An Analogy: 
Chunking pieces of code together called librariesf or ease of use, speed and management. 

### Day 48: Thursday 23rd July, 2020 ### 
SQL, Responsive Web Design 

### Day 49: Monday 27th July, 2020 ### 

Introduction to C#, learning how to output and input with console and how to store date into variables.

Working with conditions, creating applications to put knowledge into practice

### Day 50: Tuesday 28th July, 2020 ###

Continuing with C# , building website with login and a secure password, Responsive Web Design, OOP in C# 


### Day 51: Wednesday 5th August, 2020 ### 

I've been caught up with doing some wireframing, learning about  UX/UI design. But today I finally managed to work on my web app, styling the website and centring images and text on GOORM 

Also worked with Shopify Development

### Day 53: Thursday 6th August, 2020 ### 

Learned some new ways to style buttons and nav bar for my web app. 
Continued experimenting with styling CSS in the IDE. 
I also learned about software development standards yesterday. 

I also continued with responsive web design module. Made a couple of mistakes so will try again today. 

Tomorrow will be diving into databases again, and how to use it in my website.

**Thoughts**

I really want to start narrowing down what projects and activities I do. I feel that I am quite behind. But I don't want to think that way. 

At the end of this challenge, I do want to build my own app or at least build something. I feel that tutorials don't really mean anything unless we produce something. 

### Day 54: Tuesday 11th August, 2020 ### 

A lot of tasks are slowly building up so I would like to 
work towards building a more productive approach.
I think I figured out a way to insert a stylesheet into EJS. 
It was quite a discovery journey for me. 

### Day 55: Wednesday 12th August, 2020 ### 

Making a lot of progress with my courses. I think I'm done with
Colt's Udemy course. I ended up styling my web page myself, and figuring out how to 
fix my images and code. 
Started with ReactJS Frontend Web Development for Beginners.
I learned to work with my Windows Terminal today and calling
the command line. 

Installed Nodejs and global installation of React.
There are several commands in react that I am working with. 

**Thoughts** 

I am feeling quite overwhelmed with the abundance of work I am tackling right now. However, this calls for nothing but time management, discovering efficient ways to complete tasks and prioritise. 

While creating these projects, I am also learning a variety of soft skills such as introspection, different mindset when coding, changing my mindset when working towards particular tasks. 

We will get tbere. 

### Day 56: Thursday 13th August, 2020 ### 

Building on React 

### Day 57: Friday 14th August, 2020 ### 

Continued learning react and building my app. 

**Thoughts** 
I have been juggling quite a number of tasks lately. I would like to manage my time more efficiently. I've been using the app Notion to track my work. 

Time to reset and start again! 

### Day 58: Tuesday, 18th August, 2020 ### 

Went through React Fundamental Components
React DOM render ()
Learning more about JSX and the best practices when writing React code
Getting used to my organisational structure

### Day 59: Thursday, 27th August, 2020 ### 

I have been occupied with other tasks that coding is taking a back seat at the moment. I really want to be more consistent. 
I have been prioritising my Certificate course at the moment. 

Today I did some revision on installing MongoDB and understanding basic commands. 
I feel like most of this course is purely self-taught and constant problem solving on my end. 

Installing MongoDB took longer than required. Sometimes the videos on Udemy are outdated and so it inhibits my progress because I end up having to google and consult 
other resources in order for me to progress. 
Here is a simpler way to install MongoDb

I also revisited APIs and understanding how they work. 

### Day 60: Monday, 31st August, 2020 ### 

Continued wuth Nodejs, EJS and more. Completed off Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp,
however it is only the beginning. Colt's course is quite outdated, hence I decided to move on from that
and pick out the parts that I need working on. I think it's important to learn how to solve problems and build projects, rather than sit and watch someone do it.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 61: Tuesday, 1st September, 2020 ### 

Revisted C# as part of my deliverable for my course. 

### Day 62: Wednesday, 2nd September, 2020 ### 
Built many small apps today with C#. 
Trying to understand C# logic and data types and structures. 

**Thoughts** 
Still trying to get used to this type of programming language. 
I decided to drop multi-tasking and really focus and hone my energy on one language. 
I am spreading myself too thin.
So I'm bringing it back to C# - simply because it is part of my course. 

### Day 63: Thursday, 3rd September, 2020 ### 
Was revising some concepts in C#, being more familiary with data structures 
Figuring out an algorithm so I can apply it to a program

### Day 64: Friday, 4th September, 2020 ### 
Coded in object oriented programming today with C. Learning the importance of classes and assigning attributes 
Went through encapsulation 

Started a budget tracker project for github 

### Day 65: Wednesday, 9th September, 2020 ### 
Continued revising some JS concepts and started to style my budget tracker

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.


### Day 66: Monday, 14th September, 2020 ### 
Learned coding concepts in C# such as: 
-encapsulation 
-properties 
-static members

### Day 67: Friday 18th September, 2020 ### 

Learned the principles of SOLID in software development 
Working with constructors, namespaces and utilities to minimise lengthy code in C#. 

### Day 68: Monday, 21th September, 2020 ###

Continued with C# 

### Day 69: Tuesday, 22nd September, 2020 ###
Switched my phone to developer mode as I begin doing some testing and coding for a mobile app! 


### Day 70: Wednesday, 23rd September, 2020 ###

Continuing with android development and C#. 
Really getting back into the groove with picking up some JS projects again. 

Challenging times!
