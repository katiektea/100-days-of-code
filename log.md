# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 14, 2020
Today's Progress: Officially publicly pledged my commitment to the #100daysofcode challenge. Below is a number of code and tech related things I worked on: -> Did a quick recap of fundamental HTML/CSS. I am self-learning off Udemy.com - The Web Developer Bootcamp

-> Worked with algorithms and coded a program using C language as part of the CS50 coursework on Edx.
-> Activated and dedicated an official instagram account for my self-learning journey in code. 
Find here: https://www.instagram.com/katiekodes/
-> Set up an official Github account and still trying to get my head around the interface. I'm not too sure what all the functions mean or do so I am learning as I go

-> Lastly, set up my official website dedicated to coding projects, creative works at the like. It is simply a portfolio that I had my mind on for a while for all my works including writing, travel, cooking, technology posts etc. I decided this opportunity would be fitting for me to weave all those elements into one, nestled neatly in one website, which I will be launching very soon.

**Thoughts**: I really struggle with organising my thoughts when it comes to coding. I hope to improve this in time. C language is really a challenge. In fact, I still struggle with C, because I feel there is a little bit of logic behind it. Nevertheless, I feel I'll get better with it once I become more used to coding, recognising patterns and simply practicing.


### Day 2: April 15, 2020
Today's progress involved: 
-Diving into HTML5 today, transitioned from beginner to intermediate
-Began working with CSS today. Using learned concepts and applying it to build my website. 

**Thoughts**:  
I learned a crucial lesson today. This involved being able to organise my thoughts and manage my time well. I often find myself in a rabbit hole, link hopping and just HUNGRY for learning more and more. I tend to get distracted with learning multiple languages, but it is imperative to slow down and take it one at a time. 

Overall, today I discovered these soft skills are significant to successfully and smoothly continue my work in code, and everywhere else in life.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
