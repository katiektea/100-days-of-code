# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 14, 2020
Today's Progress: Officially publicly pledged my commitment to the #100daysofcode challenge. Below is a number of code and tech related things I worked on: -> Did a quick recap of fundamental HTML/CSS. I am self-learning off Udemy.com - The Web Developer Bootcamp

-> Worked with algorithms and coded a program using C language as part of the CS50 coursework on Edx.
-> Activated and dedicated an official instagram account for my self-learning journey in code. 
Find here: https://www.instagram.com/katiekodes/
-> Set up an official Github account and still trying to get my head around the interface. I'm not too sure what all the functions mean or do so I am learning as I go

-> Lastly, set up my official website dedicated to coding projects, creative works at the like. It is simply a portfolio that I had my mind on for a while for all my works including writing, travel, cooking, technology posts etc. I decided this opportunity would be fitting for me to weave all those elements into one, nestled neatly in one website, which I will be launching very soon.

**Thoughts**: I really struggle with organising my thoughts when it comes to coding. I hope to improve this in time. C language is really a challenge. In fact, I still struggle with C, because I feel there is a little bit of logic behind it. Nevertheless, I feel I'll get better with it once I become more used to coding, recognising patterns and simply practicing.


### Day 2: April 15, 2020
Today's progress involved: 
-Diving into HTML5 today, transitioned from beginner to intermediate
-Began working with CSS today. Using learned concepts and applying it to build my website. 

**Thoughts**:  
I learned a crucial lesson today. This involved being able to organise my thoughts and manage my time well. I often find myself in a rabbit hole, link hopping and just HUNGRY for learning more and more. I tend to get distracted with learning multiple languages, but it is imperative to slow down and take it one at a time. 

Overall, today I discovered these soft skills are significant to successfully and smoothly continue my work in code, and everywhere else in life. 

### Day 3: April 16, 2020 
üëâüèªLearned about debugging on C today with #CS50
üëâüèªLearning to style my HTML code with CSS
üëâüèªUnderstanding CSS rules for styling the UI

**Thoughts** 
I learned to manage my time better, breaking big tasks into bite sized chunks to work with. A similar concept is applied when hiking. We all want to conquer the mountain, but it is about taking individual steps, slowly walking the incline until we reach the top.
Most importantly, remem bering or even better, LEARNING to take breaks. Understanding our bodies and minds needs breaks. A habit of mine is that get so obsessed with my work, I forget to take a break.

I closed the laptop yesterday at 12am. Crazy...Need to learn to take breaks.  
Something I will learn to improve along the way, in code and conquering the mountain! 

### Day 4: April 17, 2020
#100daysofcode [Day 004/100]: 

Today I decided to mix it up rather than do my usual coding. 

I attended a Webinar held by @GA and was doing a live code-along, along with other students so it felt more inclusive.

**Thoughts***

Coding is starting to feel natural to me now, grasping the concept of HTML and CSS, consequently leading to me having 
a glimpse of JS today. I personally feel that I should be doing more projects than following the exercises from the courses I'm doing. 
Perhaps that will be the challenge for next week. 

In terms of soft skills, I would like to be more productive and efficient in my work. Rather than spending long hours coding. Regardless, I am having fun! So it's not all that bad. :) 

### Day 5: April 19, 2020
Learned how to use Class CSS to style multiple HTML elements. 
Because it was the weekend, I decided to play some games in code. 
So I jumped into playing this game: https://www.bt.com/codeacake/ 

**Thoughts** 

I find it hard to keep up with coding on the weekends. Things somewhat slow down? So I end up not doing much code or studying. 
I'm sure that's okay right? :D sometimes we all need a little break :') 

### Day 6: April 20, 2020 

Did everything CSS today; from specificity levels to important selectors, to fumbling around with borders and colours. 
Also had some fun with manipulating and interacting with different websites' elements using the Chrome Inspector. How cool is that! 

**Thoughts** 
Not much coding done as it is the weekend, so I decided to take a break. I feel like it is good to take a break from my streaks every now and then, so I did miss a day on Sunday. 
However! As per the FAQ on the #100daysofcode challenge, it is okay to miss a day, but as long as you continue the day after, it's fine.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
